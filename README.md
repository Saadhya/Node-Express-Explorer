# Nodejs = js lib + runtime env
- open-source, cross-platform runtime env for developing server-side applications
- way to run js on v8 engine outside browser
- v8 doesnot know file system or dom
- other context are provided - network API, file system, core OS

# CLIENT SIDE PROGRAMMING
- manage behaviour and apperance
- create interactive web page
- communicate with the server
- is written using html css js

# SERVER SIDE PROGRAMMING
- all type of programs that run on web server
- is written on several lang, such as JAVA & python
- delivers customised content efficiently as per user request.
- used to refine resp based on user data
- can use js code in node.js env

# features of Nodejs
- used to write server-side programming
- async and can hendle multiple reqs from clients and process them efficiently.
- enables devs to work on server to build apps
- provides an extensive library of js modules

# key features
- Asynchronous
- very fast, 
- single-threaded with event looping
- no buffering
- event driven= helps the server to get a resp from previous API call

# Node js components
CLI, NPM, package.json
Third party modules- Mongoose/mongoDB
Node core modules- http, url, querystring, fs

# Advantages of Nodejs 
- Non-blocking IO calls:- It processes connections in order of priority & enables apps to server simultaneously
- simple & popular js language
- Powered by v8 engine
- good for both frontend & backend
- Rick ecosystem
- Not good for CPU-intensive operations

# helps to build
- web server:-> Real time server, socket connections, concurrent connections
- APIs with NoSQL
- Cmd utilities

# Node-Express-Explorer
Group of different nodejs POC

# node-test-app
- advanced testing 
- equal, strictEqual, deepStrictEqual

# mocha and chai
- mocha is a feature rich js test framework running on nodejs
- mocha tests run serially & allow flexible and accurate reporting
- chai is an assertion library that helps in extending test frameworks
- chai provides functions and methods for accuracy
